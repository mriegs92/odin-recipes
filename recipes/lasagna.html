    <p>A Brazilian Classic from my Wife Ceci. Most of us have come to know and love italian 
        style lasagna.However, I encourage you to to broaden your horizons and give Italy's 
         Brazilian counterpart a try. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>EVOO</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 medium <em>yellow</em> onion, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>8 oz ground beef</li>
            <li>1 lb lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>8 oz sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>8 oz shaved ham</li>
            <li>2.5 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan or <em>asiago</em></li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Melt the two tablespoons of butter, 
                then stir in your flour. Cook for two minutes, stirring constantly. Add in 
                1.5 tsp of salt and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. Whisk in 
                the cup of milk slowly. When the mixture has thickened and is smooth, whisk 
                in your pinch of nutmeg. Set the pot aside.</li>
            <li>Heat another skillet over medium high heat. Add in a drizzle of extra virgin 
                olive oil. Put the minced onions in the pan and cook them until they are 
                softened (2-3 minutes). Then add the garlic and ground beef. Cook until the 
                beef is browned. Strain off any excess grease. </li>    
            <li>Add in your tomatoes, 2.5 tsp of salt, and oregano. Let the mixture simmer 
                for a few minutes.</li> 
            <li>While the beef simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook 
                the lasagna noodles until they are al dente (flexible, but still firm).
                 Strain the noodles and return them to the pot.</li>     
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>   
            <li>Now we are ready to start layering (we will have four layers total). In a 
                casserole dish, layer a few spoonfuls of the meat mixture. Cover the meat
                 with a layer of lasagna noodles. Then put another layer of meat, followed 
                 by mozzarella, followed by ham. Repeat until you have four complete layers, 
                 then cover the whole dish with the bechamel sauce. Top with your parmesan 
                 or asiago cheese. </li>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, 
                until the cheese is melted and the mixture is bubbling. Bake for an 
                additional five minutes uncovered to let the cheese crisp up a little,
                if you want. </li> 
             <li>Serve with crusty bread and a fresh salad. Enjoy!</li>
