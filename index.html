      <p>This is my favorite dish that my wife makes. Before I met her italian style lasagna was
        one of my favorite dishes. In fact, I didn't know there was anything out there <em>but</em>
        italian lasagna. However, after being introduced to the brazilian version, with its 
        inclusion of ham, a white sauce and brazilian cheeses my preferences changed forever. 
        Give her recipe a try and maybe yours will too!</p>

      <p>Oxtails have long been my favorite food. It coulde be Jamaican, Trinidadian, Brazilian 
        or Mexican style and it will have my love. Given my vast experience trying out different
         cultures takes on Oxtail Stew I figured I'd make one the takes the best attributes from 
         each.</p>  
      
      <p>Nothing else compares to the davory golden brown goodness of Oxtails Stew. <strong>Beware!</strong>
         The mix of savory, spicy, and slightly sweet may throw you into a feeding frenzy! </p>
